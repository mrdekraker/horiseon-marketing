## Description

This week's challenge was an on-the-job ticket, which meant that I would receive starter code to edit and modify. The purpose behind this project was to assess what I have learned within my lessons so far and then apply them to the given code to make the landing page functional and the code as clean as I can.

The main focus was to:

1. Reduce redunadant code.
2. Update coding methodologies.
3. Increase accessibility.
4. Do so without affecting webpage aesthetic.

The first aesthetic code I applied was to add an a:hover on the navigation bar. Hovering over the links adds a subtle change to the color of the text to match the color of the 'seo' in the Horiseon name on the navbar.

No hover:

Hover: (Notice the Online Reputation Management has changed)

The second thing I did was wrap the entire Navigation bar with a div and added a flex-box to it so that the links would stack nicely under the company name when the screen size was adjusted. It was a combination of media queries and bootstrap to get it to stack just right.

Mobile size:

Within the CSS file of this project, I cleaned up the coding so that DRY code was eliminated.

I also added a "wrapper" flex-box div around both the marketing services section and the benefits section so that when the screen was adjusted it would descale cleanly.

My most time consuming aspect that I experienced was figuring out flex-box correctly. Link under credits for the tutorial I followed.
